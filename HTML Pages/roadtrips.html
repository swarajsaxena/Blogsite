            <h1>Top 5 Best Road Trips in India </h1>

            <p>Well, a traveller or not, who would want to miss out on any trip, especially after being restricted for
                more than a year? If you are someone who is always keen to witness the scenic journey travelling from
                one city to another, also meeting less known places and towns in between, then road trips are the best
                thing you can ever do for your adventurous soul.</p>

            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558980395-2f289089d3ec?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80"
                alt="Road trips">

            <p>So, here are the top 5 best road trips in India that you should definitely consider for taking a break
                from your everyday repetitive life.</p>

            <p class="bold">1. Manali to Leh Highway</p>

            <p>On this road trip, you will not only witness the mountains on both sides, but you will also witness
                greenery, which will take over once you pass the Atal Tunnel. It would be more fun to travel via
                criss-cross land if you take this trip anytime between June to September.</p>

            <p>Distance - 473 Km approx.</p>

            <p>Time - 2 days</p>

            <p class="bold">2. Chennai to Pondicherry </p>

            <p>South Indian cities have their own beauty. This road trip is pretty unique from any other road trip. The
                sea on one side and greenery on the other side will never make you wish that the journey ever ends. Keep
                your cameras ready when riding on this road.
                The best time to visit Pondicherry is either during the monsoon or winters.
            </p>

            <p>Distance - 165 Km</p>

            <p>Time - 3 hours</p>

            <p class="bold">3. Ahmedabad to Daman</p>

            <p>This will be a heart-warming journey from Ahmedabad to this popular union territory. You will enjoy it
                more if you visit this place in winter. Daman still has the essence of the Portuguese colonial past,
                which can be quite fascinating for history lovers.
            </p>

            <p>Distance - 364 Km</p>

            <p>Time - 6 hours approx.</p>

            <p class="bold">4. Bangalore to Bandipur</p>

            <p>For those who are nemophilists and love seeing wildlife in their natural habitat, a trip to Bandipur is
                the one they will never forget. This road trip through the forest is full of excitement, as one may spot
                animals wandering by the road. It would be a great experience if you visit this national park in the
                monsoon season, which is between July and September or during the summer, between March to May.
            </p>

            <p>Distance - 224 Km</p>

            <p>Time - 2 hours 30 mins</p>

            <p class="bold">5. Jaipur to Jaisalmer</p>

            <p>This road trip will give you a ride from one culture of Rajasthan to another. The Pink city to Golden
                city journey will change the colours as temples and palaces are made of yellow sandstone. November to
                March is the best time to dive into the desert and wander in the royal palaces of Jaisalmer.
                All these places are no less than the others and have their own beauty and culture. The diversity of
                India will leave you awestruck every time you visit another city or another village.

            </p>

            <p>Distance - 557 Km</p>

            <p>Time- 10 hours approx. </p>
