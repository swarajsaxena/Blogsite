                <div class="desc roadtrip-desc">

                    <p>Well, a traveller or not, who would want to miss out on any trip, especially after being
                        restricted for
                        more than a year? If you are someone who is always keen to witness the scenic journey travelling
                        from
                        one city to another, also meeting less known places and towns in between, then road trips are
                        the best
                        thing you can ever do for your adventurous soul.
                    </p>

                    <p>So, here are the top 5 best road trips in India that you should definitely consider for taking a
                        break
                        from your everyday repetitive life.</p>

                    <p class="bold">1. Manali to Leh Highway</p>

                    <p>On this road trip, you will not only witness the mountains on both sides, but you will also
                        witness
                        greenery, which will take over once you pass the Atal Tunnel. It would be more fun to travel via
                        criss-cross land if you take this trip anytime between June to September.</p>

                    <p>Distance - 473 Km approx.</p>

                    <p>Time - 2 days</p>

                        trip. The
                        sea on one side and greenery on the other side will never make you wish that the journey ever
                        ends. Keep
                        your cameras ready when riding on this road.
                        The best time to visit Pondicherry is either during the monsoon or winters.

                        past,
                        which can be quite fascinating for history lovers.

                        the one they will never forget. This road trip through the forest is full of excitement, as one
                        may spot
                        animals wandering by the road. It would be a great experience if you visit this national park in
                        the
                        monsoon season, which is between July and September or during the summer, between March to May.

                        Golden
                        city journey will change the colours as temples and palaces are made of yellow sandstone.
                        November to
                        March is the best time to dive into the desert and wander in the royal palaces of Jaisalmer.

                        Coronavirus not only affected the health of people but the economy too, which led many
                        businesses to
                        shift their focus from the offline world to the online one. But as someone said, “Change is the
                        only
                        constant”, therefore every change brings an opportunity which in this case is making the best
                        use of
                        the digital world in reference to the respective business style.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digital platforms offer us many ways and techniques to grow our business but which tool or
                        technique
                        will perform better is constantly changing. No matter if you are a newbie to this digital realm
                        or
                        you are an experienced user, you need to adapt yourself to the new trends and keep brushing up
                        your
                        services and content by the hit and trial method.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So here are some digital marketing trends in 2021 which as an enterprise you should get your
                        hands
                        into-
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        1. Increase in the Voice Search by users
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        According to the digital marketing expert, Neil Patel, the graph of Google analytics will move
                        downwards because of the increased use of Voice Search.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is what he said, “There actually isn’t much wrong with it. It’s a great tool, especially
                        considering that it’s free. But marketing is changing. New channels are being constantly
                        introduced,
                        such as voice search.” (He’s referring ‘it’ to the Google Analytics)
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        2. Depersonalisation; difficult to digest but will pave the way!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Buyers have become smart by coming across the same personalized strategies all over the
                        internet,
                        which is writing names in the email which will not work as effectively as it used to. The
                        problem is
                        not in the personalization but is in the same conventional strategies. So to survive in the
                        digital
                        world you need to come up with new innovative ideas.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        3. Use of Long Tail Keywords
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now the marketers have dropped the idea of writing lengthy content and are inclined to use
                        long-tail
                        keywords which are less competitive and help the content get ranked on Google. Long-tail
                        keywords
                        will help your website to get organic traffic.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        4. Chatbots
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This AI technology will continue to be used by marketers because of its 24/7 services to the
                        customers. These chatbots reply instantly to any of the customers’ queries, which increases customer
                        satisfaction, which is why customers prefer chatbots.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        5. Video Marketing
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Video marketing will be a trend in 2021 because video brings customers closer to the brand and
                        builds their trust in their authenticity which is important for a business to increase its sales.
                        72% of businesses claim to see an increase in their conversion rate and 70% of customers share a
                        brand’s video.
                    </p>

                    <p class="nold">
                        6. Influencer Marketing
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Influencer marketing is a form of marketing wherein investors use popular personalities to endorse
                        their products. Influencer marketing is not just a trend but is highly profitable as well, for it
                        has also shown a rise in the income of the investors. This is due to the reason that people often
                        tend to consider the products more authentic if a popular and trusted person endorses it and shares
                        his or her own experience. The influencers also help in generating a larger audience by using their
                        own social media platforms to promote a product.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bold">
                        7. Customer Segmentation
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It will be more beneficial for a business to launch a large number of small marketing campaigns,
                        targeting segregated audiences than to launch a small number of large marketing campaigns for a
                        large general audience. Grouping of the audiences can be done on the basis of location, behaviour,
                        age etc. This helps businesses to cater to the needs of the customers more effectively.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These trends are here to stay until another challenge strikes but your work never ends, does it? As
                        a marketer or a business, you have to be always prepared for the things which might not work for you
                        in the future even if it is working for now. But by keeping eyes on the fluctuations and deviations
                        happening within your business or outside of it, will make you stand tall and flourish for a longer
                        run.
